## Here are some websites I have found online which prove Dobromił Duda / Antypodish, a Polish UK citizen and PhD of Lancaster University, was not only involved in but operated the suspected scam "PipsTycoon"<br>

Of all people Dobromił Duda is a PhD studying at Lancaster University, he could have put his talents to a better use.<br>
<br>
While it is disputed whether ultimately this operation was a scam, it seems many users do feel that towards the end of it's life span they had been scammed, also, it is worth noting that Dobromił Duda even specifies on his personal site how he ran, now defunct online game, PipsTycoon. So surly he himself feels he never operated a scam.<br>
<br>
So this is where I feel it's up to you, as users to decide how innocent or guilty this individual is based on the evidence provided above, but what I will say is that it's very easy for some people to cut and run when bitcoin projects go south, and it certainly seems like that is what Dobromił Duda did from what we can make of the information above.<br>
<br>
There are some honest people out there who will pay back every satoshi to their users, some of which include notorious drug markets. So in that respect, if he cut and ran on even just a few people, technically he did run a scam, but more importantly it reflects upon how this individual ultimately operated in a dishonest way to benefit himself.
